# C4G Manifest

## Project Goal

To create a universal solution for configuration in projects that we can use ourselves and that other users will choose over writing their own or other solutions available on the market.

## Production Ready

Our solution releases should work reliably and without errors.
Users should not receive a non-functional solution with bugs.

## What a C4G Team Member Should Do

### Be Congruent and Adhere to Agreements

To work in a team, effectively plan, and divide tasks, team members need to rely on each other.
This means each member should take responsibility for their part of the work—thinking, saying, and doing the same thing.
Follow agreements, and honestly and promptly report any issues.

### Be Proactive

The project is fueled by enthusiasm. No one has financial or legal obligations.
This means there won’t be a "manager" who will drive the team with a stick of salary reductions or a carrot of increases to extract solutions and results.
Thus, each team member should self-motivate to continue working on the project, and voice ideas and suggestions "without asking" when they see fit.

### Be Polite and Respectful

We’re all human, and from time to time, tense moments may arise in communication.
In such situations, and in general, team members should be polite to each other.
Avoid personal attacks and insults.

### Do Your Job Well

The project is not small and will consist of several interconnected parts.
Each member will work on their part, and the result of their work will affect the work of others.
The final result depends on the quality of each member’s work.

Clarification: When performing your part, always put yourself in the shoes of another member to ensure that both you and they will benefit from the outcome of your work.

### Give and Receive Feedback Productively

Team members have different levels of knowledge and experience.
To work effectively together, they should exchange knowledge and experience through constructive feedback.
Members should give and receive feedback openly and honestly.
When giving feedback, a member should provide facts and arguments/solutions to help improve the recipient’s work.
When receiving feedback, a member should view it not as a personal attack but as an experienced perspective that can help them improve their work.
