# Decision record for unity as the only entry point

## Status

accepted

## Context

To release early and prove concept of the tool we must limit support of platforms
engines and frameworks
And also user-stories of how they could use the tool
Tool must be simple and provide required amount of functionality to solve main users issues

## Decision

Use only unity as entry point for the tool

## Consequences

Much less code in comparison to multi-framework approach (Unreal Engine integration for instance)
Simplicity and convenience of the code base
Not maximum user coverage
